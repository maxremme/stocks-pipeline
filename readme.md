# Data Pipeline Project: Stock Information Retrieval and Visualization
## Overview

This project implements a data pipeline for retrieving stock information from Google, 
storing it in Google Sheets, and visualizing it using a Streamlit cloud frontend. 
The pipeline consists of four main components: two AWS Lambda functions, a Google Sheets doc and a Streamlit web application.

### Components
#### 1. Initial Data Retrieval

    Function Name: main_lambda.py
    Description: This AWS Lambda function makes an initial API call to 
   google stock information for a chosen stock, including 
    Symbol, Date, Open, Close, High, Low, and Volume. 
    It executes once a day.

#### 2. Data Storage and Population

    Function Name: main_save_lambda.py
    Description: This AWS Lambda function is triggered upon the successful execution of the initial data retrieval function. 
    It takes the retrieved stock information and populates a Google Spreadsheet with the data.

#### 3. Streamlit Cloud Frontend

    File Name: stocks_app.py
    Description: This Streamlit web application fetches data from the Google Sheets populated by the second Lambda function. 
    It provides a user-friendly interface for visualizing the stock data through interactive graphs and charts.

#### Understanding Stock Data Fields

    fOpen: The opening price of the stock on a given date.
    fClose: The closing price of the stock on a given date.
    fHigh: The highest price of the stock on a given date.
    fLow: The lowest price of the stock on a given date.
    fVolume: The trading volume (number of shares traded) on a given date.

#### Different Types of Graphs

The Streamlit frontend offers various interactive graphs to analyze stock data:

    Daily Trading Volume: This graph displays the daily trading volume for the selected stock, 
    helping users identify patterns in trading activity.

    Bollinger Bands: Bollinger Bands provide insights into stock price volatility 
    by showing the price's upper and lower bands relative to its moving average.

    Daily High vs. Low Price: This graph visualizes the daily high and low prices for the selected stock,
     allowing users to observe price fluctuations throughout the day.
